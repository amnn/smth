# Runner text passthrough behavior

Ordinary markdown text should be written back to the transcript exactly as it appears in the input
when no actionable directives are present.

The runner should preserve headings, paragraphs, punctuation, and spacing without adding any extra
callouts.

## A nested heading

Plain text lines should remain plain text lines.

Another paragraph follows to make sure multi-paragraph content is faithfully passed through.

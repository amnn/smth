# Runner pane directive behavior

## Single pane target succeeds without warning

Selecting a concrete pane target should update the active pane selection without producing a
warning.

    :pane 0.0

## Missing pane target emits an error callout

A target that does not exist should produce a warning with error details from tmux.

    :pane does-not-exist

## Window target resolves to one active pane

Window-level targets should still resolve to one pane selection.

    :tmux split-window -d
    :pane 0

## Explicit pane id target is unambiguous

Selecting a specific pane id target after a split should succeed without warning.

    :pane %1

## Explicit pane index target is unambiguous

Pane-index targets should resolve directly to that pane.

    :pane 0.1

## Pane ids that no longer exist emit warnings

After removing a pane, selecting that removed pane id should fail with a warning.

    :tmux kill-pane -t 0.1
    :pane %1

## Window target still resolves after pane removal

After removing one pane, selecting the window target should still succeed.

    :pane 0

# Scripting

`smth` accepts fzf-style startup flags for scripted bindings.

Repository context is selected independently from discovery:

- `-b`, `--base REPO` uses a repository or workspace as the base context. A
  named workspace uses its repository's default checkout when available,
  following the same resolution as current-directory inference.
- `-B`, `--no-base` suppresses repository inference from the current working
  directory.
- With neither option, the nearest repository containing the current working
  directory is used when available.
- `-o`, `--onto REV` sets the revision used as the base of newly created
  workspaces. It defaults to `trunk()` and requires a repository base when
  supplied explicitly.
- `-r`, `--repo GLOB` adds repositories to discovery; it does not select the
  base context.
- `--repo-root PATH` selects the parent for fresh repository creation. It
  overrides `[repo].root`; without either setting, the process working
  directory is used. Relative paths are resolved from that directory, and a
  leading `~` path component expands to the user's home directory. This option
  does not add repositories to discovery.

The picker and filtering modes support these startup options:

- `-q`, `--query STR` seeds the interactive query.
- `-1`, `--select-1` switches immediately when the initial query has one
  match.
- `-0`, `--exit-0` exits instead of opening the UI when the initial query has
  no matches.
- `-f`, `--filter` skips the UI and prints matches for the query from `--query`;
  combine it with `-1` to switch when there is exactly one match.
- `--json` skips the UI and emits structured records for live sessions and
  repository candidates. It cannot be combined with `--filter` or `--select-1`.
  `--query` narrows the output with the picker's fuzzy matcher. `--exit-0` is
  ignored so that an empty result is always emitted as `[]`.

## Structured inspection

`smth --json` emits a JSON array. Every record includes its resolved tmux name
and live and deletion state. Repo-backed records include the normalized default
workspace path to pass to `--base`; plain sessions omit `base`. The `name` field
contains a named-workspace or plain-session operand and is omitted for a default
checkout. `path` is omitted when no checkout exists, `flagged` appears only for
live sessions, and `attention` and `agents` are omitted when empty.

Use the `base` and `name` fields together when constructing a lifecycle
command. Do not substitute a discovery glob or derive a target from the tmux
name: collision suffixes and repository metadata are resolved independently.

## Lifecycle commands

Lifecycle commands are mutually exclusive with each other, `--filter`, and
`--json`. They also reject `--query`, `--select-1`, and `--exit-0`, and never
fall back to the interactive picker.

- `--flag [SESSION]` marks a matching live session as flagged.
- `--unflag [SESSION]` clears that state.
- `-c`, `--create [SESSION]` ensures the target exists without switching the
  current tmux client and prints its actual tmux name.
- `-s`, `--switch [SESSION]` performs the same ensure operation, then switches
  the current tmux client.
- `-x`, `--close [SESSION]` kills a matching live tmux session without removing
  its checkout or workspace registration.
- `-d`, `--delete SESSION` forgets and removes a matching discovered named
  workspace session, then closes it when live.

Flag operations are idempotent. An explicit session operand overrides a named
workspace inferred from `--base`; without a repository base, a plain session
name is required. Repo-backed operations verify both the normalized repository
family and workspace checkout metadata before changing the tmux option.

Create starts a tmux session for an existing default or named checkout. If a
named workspace does not exist, create adds it beside the default checkout at
`--onto` (or `trunk()`), then starts tmux. A plain session starts in the process
working directory. Newly created tmux sessions run `tmux.setup`; existing live
sessions are left unchanged.

Names are sanitized and disambiguated against existing tmux sessions, sibling
workspaces, and checkout paths. Collisions use the first available `~N` suffix
(`~1`, `~2`, and so on). If the resulting tmux name would be empty, it instead
uses the first available numeric name (`1`, `2`, and so on). Callers should use
the printed name.

Switching to an existing live session prefers its first window with a bell or
agent attention, matching interactive picker behavior.

Add the no-argument `--create-repo` modifier to `--create [NAME]` or
`--switch [NAME]` to initialize a fresh repository before creating its session.
An omitted name is treated as empty for disambiguation. The resolved repository
context must be empty. Use `--no-base` when current-directory inference would
otherwise select a repository; passing `--base` is invalid, and `--onto` does
not apply. The destination is `<repo-root>/<resolved-name>`. Repeated requests
create new repositories rather than reuse existing sessions or checkouts;
existing directories are never initialized. It creates a missing repository
root, runs `jj git init --colocate` for the destination, starts tmux in that
checkout, records the checkout as repository metadata, and runs `tmux.setup`.

Delete requires both a repository base and an explicit named workspace session.
It rejects plain sessions and the default workspace. Use `--repo` to surface a
non-live checkout that is not otherwise discovered. The command itself is the
confirmation: it forgets the workspace from jj, removes the checkout, and only
then closes the session when live.
